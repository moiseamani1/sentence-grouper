# Sentence Grouper

**An application of Natural Language Processing**

I have built a simple sentence grouping online tool with Tensorflow.js. This use case illustrates the typical sentence similarity implementations that are in place when we interact with searches or company chatbots.
        
 My Sentence Grouper tool is built using the following simple technologies:
 
* Semantic UI
* ExpressJs and NodeJs
* Embedded JavaScript Templating (EJS)
* TensorFlow.js
* Universal sentence encoder
